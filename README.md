This is repository where I will attach my example of bug reports

In the <a href="https://walkme.dog">Walkme App</a> project, I took a part as QA Engineer, and of course, there were bugs during the development process.

All next examples will be provided as screenshots from the Trello platform that I used for creating a bug reports

During writing bug reports I try to follow the rule that a bug report in its summary should answer three main questions: "What?", "Where?", and "When."
</p>

#### Bug report example №1

I'll additionaly explain you what specific writing rules I used: 
1. Summary of the ticket
2. The type of the ticket (Trello doesn't have specofic bug report ticket type in a free version)
3. The module to which the found bug belongs (in this case it's backend)
4. Types of the issue, that helps you to do some metricks in the future
5. Ticket participants (asidnee, reporter, additional participants)
6. Ticket priority
7. Possible attachments

#### Bug report example №2
One more bug report, wrote by the same rules

#### Bug report example №3
Sometimes, there are many bugs in one module (as it wrote in the 7 main testing rules). In this case, I had not enough time to create 6 separated bug reports, and I and my team agreed this bug report style
